📌 Project Overview

This project combines SolidWorks and MATLAB Simscape Multibody to model and simulate the dynamic behavior of a robotic arm. By integrating these powerful tools, we can analyze and optimize the robotic arm's motion, forces and control systems before physical implementation. Code for Circular motion, Spiral motion and Lemniscate motion are also available.

🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

- SolidWorks: Designed a detailed 3D model of the robotic arm.

- MATLAB & Simulink: Developed control algorithms and simulated dynamics.

- Simscape Multibody: Visualized joint movements, forces and interactions.

- Simscape Multibody Link: Seamlessly exported the SolidWorks model to MATLAB.
