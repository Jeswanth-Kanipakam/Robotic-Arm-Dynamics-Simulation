üìå Project Overview

This project combines SolidWorks and MATLAB Simscape Multibody to model and simulate the dynamic behavior of a robotic arm. By integrating these powerful tools, we can analyze and optimize the robotic arm's motion, forces, and control systems before physical implementation. Code for Circular motion, Spiral motion and Lemniscate motion are also available.

üîß Tools & Technologies Used

- SolidWorks: Designed a detailed 3D model of the robotic arm.

- MATLAB & Simulink: Developed control algorithms and simulated dynamics.

- Simscape Multibody: Visualized joint movements, forces, and interactions.

- Simscape Multibody Link: Seamlessly exported the SolidWorks model to MATLAB.

üöÄ Key Features

- 3D Model Development: A realistic and robust robotic arm model created in SolidWorks.

- Seamless Integration: The design was imported into MATLAB using Simscape Multibody Link.

- Control Algorithm Implementation: Developed controllers for smooth and precise movement.

- Physics-Based Simulation: Modeled real-world forces, torques, and kinematics.

- Graphical & Mechanics Explorer Visualization: Observed joint interactions dynamically.
